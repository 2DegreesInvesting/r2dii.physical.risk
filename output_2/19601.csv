At this time, it was the first guarana with organic certification in the world. We wanted to be fair and pay the small-scale farmers a fair wage, but nevertheless achieve an affordable price for the consumer. So friendly and close collaboration with SINFO and the ""ONCA"" project began. You can find our fairly traded, climate-neutral and vegan organic guarana as a 100% pure powder or as part of the SINFO products ""Guafee"" and ""Guacao"" in your regional health food shop or here in the SINFO online shop."	http://www.sinfo-online.de	Alte Dorfstrasse 13b 	 27239 Twistringen	27239	Dietary and organic foods, Foods, health, Organic products, Prepared dishes and gourmet foods, Gastronomy - specialities, Guarana extracts, Acerola extracts, Guarana powder, Fruit and nut bars, Organic guarana nuts	Bio-guafee | Bio-guacao | Bio-guarana-extrakte 8-10% Koffein | Bio-guarana-pulver | Bio Acerola Extrakte 17% Nat.
