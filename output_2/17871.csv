The original winery of our estate is located in the village of Iphofen, Franconia's 'historic treasure box'. It is the Gypsum Keuper soil that characterizes the terroir of our Premier Vineyard Sites, of which the Julius-Echter-Berg is the most famous. There, we carefully cultivate our vines, harvest our perfect, fully ripen grapes and then lovingly guide our young wines to emerge as distinctively unique wines that will enrich your life. In competitive wine tastings, at home and abroad, Wirsching wines consistently receive the highest recognition and top rankings which reflects the success of this philosophy of quality. These wines contain every possible finesse, aroma, intensity and elegance.	http://www.wirsching.de	Ludwigstr. 16 	 97346 Iphofen	97346	Fruit, Wines, Winery	NA	NA	17871	49.678288949999995	10.333460023429751
