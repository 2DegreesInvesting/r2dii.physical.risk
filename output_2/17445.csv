At SalySavons we think that a good product depends above all on the quality of the ingredients, which is why we use only 100% natural ingredients that have been carefully selected for their multiple benefits. This ensures that you are taking the very best care of your skin, and the environment. We have chosen to use an artisan cold saponification method that provides our soaps with their unrivalled quality, because this is the only way of preserving all the benefits from vegetable oils and glycerine, which is vital for proper hydration of the skin. The Valambrun story started over two years ago.Two years spent constantly musing and thinking about natural cosmetic products, testing them and adjusting formulations until the results were perfect. This activity sits alongside the SalySavons brand that we have nurtured with passion and determination since 2017. Born of the meeting between Séverine Thomassin and Nicolas Thibon, in a human partnership rooted in shared ideals and the determination to care for others, that led to the creation of a shared new brand: Valambrun.
