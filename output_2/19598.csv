This is largely thanks to our many satisfied customers. We provide films and bags 'à la carte' to suit your individual requirements. As a supplier of films, we can fulfil virtually any requests you have relating to manual or machine packaging. We will gladly work to the specifications you provide for film thicknesses and measurements, though if you prefer, we can advise you on these instead. We supply numerous types of bags made from a diverse range of materials that hardly any other supplier in our field can boast of. If desired, we can also supply our pouches, cuts and flat sheets with flexo/gravure printing in up to 10 colours. We are an independent company, and the fact we do not need to rely on other businesses means we can make quick decisions when it comes to carrying out requests. Our ample production capacities ensure fast delivery times, even for orders with large quantities	http://www.enolfolien.de/en/, http://www.enolfolien.de/en/company.html, http://www.enolfolien.de/en/stock.html	Rapsacker 13 	 23556 Lübeck	23556	Plastic packaging, Flexible packing, Flap pouches, Bags with adhesive sealing, Header bags, Aluminium compound foil bags, Envelopes, transparent, Polybags, Flat bags, Greetings card packaging	Doypacks / Pouches | Drawstring Bags | Seal Edge Bags / Bags with quad seam | Flat bags / Cello bags | Standbags / Headerbags | Multibags | Side-Pocket-Bags | Bottom-Fold-Bags | Pleated Bags - Side fold bags | 2-Flap-Bags	united kingdom	19598	53.87214985997725	10.641020099050808
