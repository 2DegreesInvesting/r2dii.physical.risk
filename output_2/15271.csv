Another popular recommendation is to eat it with fresh bread; either on toast or as an excellent sandwich. Served in salads, finely chopped and dressed with light Modena vinegar. Further ideas include; serving together with grilled fresh green asparagus, with baked potatoes, caramelized Piquillo peppers or caramelized mixed berries. Our lamprey is also delicious with all maize bread or tartlets.	http://www.obradordelamprea.com	Pol.Ind.
