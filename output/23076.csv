QAMIAB only selects the finest red stigma for you, the most aromatic and scented part of the pistil. We never include the yellow threads that alter the taste and falsify the final weight. Packaged in France, your red gold retains its full flavour. Harvested by hand in the traditional manner: the exceptional saffron supplied by QAMIAB is grown beneath the Afghan sun before being harvested by hand in the time-honoured traditional manner. Plants are also trimmed by hand. You will always obtain the latest harvest, grown during the current season. Long reserved exclusively for starred chefs, saffron from QAMIAB is now available to other professionals and private customers. Powerful in taste and rich in flavour: to make certain that you receive outstanding Afghan saffron of exceptional quality, we also use two independent laboratories to carry out additional inspections. the first occurs in Afghanistan just before the saffron is exported, the second is in France just before it is packaged.	https://qamiab.com/, https://qamiab.com/a-propos/, https://qamiab.com/contact/	17 RUE JEAN VOILLOT 	 69500 Bron	69500	Spices, ORGANIC FARMING, Foods, gourmet, Agriculture - import-export, saffron, Quality saffron, Saffron for laboratories, Saffron for industry, Saffron for catering, Saffron for grocery stores	Libérez les pouvoirs du Safran | Profitez du prestige de l’Or Rouge | L’étape cruciale qui fait un Safran d’exception | N’exploitez que la partie la plus noble de la fleur | 1 critère de poids qui surpasse les meilleurs argumentaires de vente | Les produits Safranés que vos clients vont adorer | Comment faire dépenser plus d’argent à vos clients | Ce qui est rare, est précieux.
