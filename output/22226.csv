Quality and professionalism make us stand out. We deal with growers (for purchasing fruit), and the fruit wholesale markets. Once the fruit has been harvested in the fields, it is unloaded from our lorries in the warehouse where it is washed and treated using natural waxes and our packers immediately go to work on putting it in crates.
