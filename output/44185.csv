(ZSI) is a ISO 9001-2008 certified contract manufacturing and engineering outsourcing company. Our main priority is to help our customers become more competitive through contract manufacturing in China. We specialise in the supply of high-quality customer-specific components, finished parts and assemblies at competitive prices. We use our intercultural orientation and efficient operating processes to build cultural bridges and reduce geographical distance. This makes production outsourcing much easier and more realistic. Working closely with our customers, ZSI coordinates and monitors real production via our network of selected sub-suppliers. We do not have our own production facilities, therefore we purchase capacity from our sub-supplier network, allowing us to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire supply chain.	http://www.zsind.com/index.aspx	Marie Jorns Ring 119 	 30559 Hannover	30559	Cast iron items, contracted moulding, Actuators, aluminium casting, CNC machining centres, CNC sheet metal work, cnc metal machining, pressure moulding, Cast stainless steel, Cast iron casting	Stainless steel casting | Steel casting | Iron casting | aluminum casting | Zinc casting | Precision Casting | Cast iron | Casting | Forging | Precision machining	united kingdom	44185	52.36067667271198	9.833746149534125
