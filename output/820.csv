It develops autonomous, lastingly effective products for professionals in the agricultural sector. This is the case of acoustic scarers, AviTrac® that are currently sold in France and Europe. These devices emit sounds that scare away pest bird species (crows, pigeons, starlings, seagulls, etc.) and protect areas of up to 3 hectares. Designed for indoor and outdoor environments (IP55 waterproof junction box), these acoustic devices are fully programmable: transmission interval, operating times, sound signals and volume, etc. The different AviTrac® models are all delivered with a stainless steel frame that can be dismantled and folded away. These products have been especially designed for agriculture (cereal farmers, livestock farmers, market gardeners, etc.).	https://www.agriprotech.fr/	7, rue Ernest Tibulle 	 29300 Quimperle	29300	Agriculture - Machines & Equipment, Agriculture - import-export	Gel répulsif olfactif anti-pigeons | Filet de protection contre les oiseaux | Effaroucheur sonore anti-oiseaux | Effaroucheur sonore anti-oiseaux | Ballon effaroucheur anti-oiseaux | Ruban holographique effaroucheur anti-oiseaux | Ballons effaroucheurs anti-oiseaux	france	820	47.8981871	-3.509910877516953
