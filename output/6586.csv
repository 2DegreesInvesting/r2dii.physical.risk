This where people go for health treatments and on holiday ""just because it's good for you"" thanks to the therapeutic effects of being in nature and healthy food to eat. The company was founded in 2004 and is located in the beautiful Ostallgäu district to the east, only a few minutes' drive from the motorway exit for Rückholz/Nesselwang (A7/138). Cold-pressed vegetable oils are the most valuable components and sources of energy for a healthy and balanced diet. We place great importance on using the best raw products and we process organically produced oilseeds and nuts, from local sources where possible. In addition, we can press and individually bottle special ingredients at your request. If you would like to drop in, please give us a quick call beforehand. We do not have any fixed opening hours because someone is usually available at our organic farm. We moved our production site to Kempten in central Allgäu a few years ago."	http://www.allgaeuer-oelmuehle.de	Heisinger Straße 45 	 87437 Kempten	87437	Cereals and grains, Organic coconut flour, Organic hemp protein 50, Organic linseed flour, Organic white almond flour, Organic grape seed flour, Organic rosehip powder, Organic chia flour, Organic walnut flour, Organic pumpkin protein 60	Bio Mariendistelöl | Bio Himbeeressig | Bio Haselnussöl | Bio Apfel Balsamico | Bio Cashewkerne würzig | Bio Kürbiskernöl geröstet | Bio Kokosmehl | Bio Kürbiskerne geröstet, gesalzen | Bio Mandelmehl weiss | Bio Granatapfelkernöl	germany	6586	47.733116	10.340036798021984
