This was followed 74 years later by the company VEB Maschinenfabrik und Eisengießerei Wurzen, which was transferred to the ownership of Esterer AG in 1991 and has been trading under the name ""Esterer Gießerei Werk Wurzen GmbH"" ever since. Together with its sister company in Altötting, Esterer Gießerei GmbH, the Wurzen-based foundry was acquired by Holding Topol GmbH in 2008. Together with Esterer Gießerei Altötting, our company is now one of the leading system suppliers in Europe. Our core areas are the manufacture of geometrically complex and core-intensive products. However, our strengths also include double-walled castings, castings with low wall strength and large components weighing up to four tonnes. We guarantee our customers the maximum possible process safety, even with challenging components."	http://giesserei-wurzen.de	Dresdener Strasse 40 	 04808 Wurzen	04808	Iron, special grade and pig iron, Foundries, aluminium, Cast iron items, Model making, Hand-mould castings, Lamellar graphite cast iron, earth casting, Investment castings, Prototype castings, Refinishing of castings	Formverfahren-Spezialisierung auf komplexe Gussteile | Grauguss & Sphäroguss | Nachbehandlung | Mechanische Bearbeitung | Modellbau-Das Modell als maßgebender Faktor | Beratung & Auftragsklärung | Qualitätsmanagement | Logistik & Lagerhaltung	germany	44181	51.3843451	12.80659762365498
