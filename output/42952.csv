The company, initially established as a trading company and based in the home textiles sector, expanded in a short time, both at the Grünsfeld site (to an area of what is now around 3000 m2) and in terms of range size and sales channels. Up to this point, the company supplied only well-known furniture stores in Germany and Switzerland, chains and purchasing associations, and a few well-known discounters in Germany. Since 2017, private consumers have also been able to acquire goods from Quantum Interior via a direct distribution channel, through platform retailers such as Amazon and eBay, as well as through the company's own online shop. The harmonious interaction of committed, success-oriented employees, a range oriented towards customer requirements and entrepreneurial courage have so far formed the basis for success. With a sensitive feel for future trends, new products are regularly designed that are implemented and produced in selected production facilities. The materials for our products, as well as goods that have already been pre-assembled, are acquired from trade partners resident both in Europe (Italy, France and Germany) and in Asia (India, China).	https://www.quantum-interior.de/	Franke Str. 4 	 97947 Grünsfeld	97947	Feathers, down and miscellaneous stuffing materials, Blankets, bedspreads, duvets and eiderdowns, Pet supplies, Cushion covers, Pallet supports, seat cushions, Outdoor furniture, coordinated furnishings, garden furniture, house accessories	ORI GIN AL | Quantum Interior Hoodie | Felldecke Fox | Felldecke Husky | Felldecke Simba | Felldecke Zopfdesign Julieth | Fellkissen Zopfdesign Julieth | Felloptik Kissen Fox | Felloptik Kissen Husky | Felloptik Kissen Simba	germany	42952	49.60976289232037	9.745057589477595
