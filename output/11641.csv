france	agriculture_livestock	fish	NA	NH-CASE-FRANCE-SAS_00000005448219-788171001	NH CASE FRANCE SAS	Fecamp	101 - 200	fish, frozen and deep-frozen | frozen fish manufacturer | whitefish | multilingual assistance | accredited factories		FALSE		Manufacturer/ Producer	Over the years a close co-operative partnership has been built up between NHC UK/FR and IG for the purpose of global Procurement. Together we are able to incorporate a full technical control system in order to ensure that customer specifications and delivery schedules are met. Currently our production includes loins, portions, fillets and blocks from Iceland, Russia, New Zealand, China, Baltic States and since 2012 Vietnam. Production Volumes per Area: - Iceland - 1500mt Russia - 800mt New Zealand - 500mt Baltic - 100mt Asia - 3000mt Although Vietnam is widely recognized for its production of Pangasius and not for whitefish such as Atlantic Cod, Haddock and Alaskan Pollock it was our decision to begin producing in Vietnam at the start of 2012 to reduce alliance on production in China. China’s greatest asset has been labour cost, but over the years we have seen this benefit decreasing with the result that many factories who used to produce whitefish for export have turned their attention on a fast growing domestic market. Other factors such as finance have become an increasing worry as well, with companies struggling to open L/C’s for raw material payments and through this we have already seen casualties in China.	https://www.nhcase.com	11bis Place du Général Leclerc 	 76400 Fecamp	76400	Fish, frozen and deep-frozen, whitefish, Frozen Fish Manufacturer, multilingual assistance, Accredited Factories	NA	NA	11641	49.734451199999995	0.4033264398737819
