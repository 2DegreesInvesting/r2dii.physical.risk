With its production site in Germany, the company – now in the sixth generation – distinguishes itself through constant enhancements, such as the use of paper with grass fibres. In particular, the delivery programme includes exclusive flower wrapping paper and tissue paper with or without company print. There is a selection of 27 different coloured papers with a density of 28g/m² as well as white paper in densities of 18, 22, 28, 30 and 40g/m², which can include the high-quality ergoplus coating on request. Flowers packed in this paper remain fresh for longer during the summer and are protected against cold temperatures in the winter.
