At BeninFruit we value family and healthy tasteful food is at the heart of it all. BeninFruit came to life from years of frustration and yearning for a unique taste in a fruit from a tiny village in West Africa. Our founders and their friends when they run out of gifted pineapple from Allada village in Benin, can not find anything like it in U.S. supermarkets or farmers markets. It was impossible for them to find the same taste and smoothness in pineapples or any fruit in America. During an afternoon walk in downtown Berkeley the idea of importing the exotic golden fruit from Africa to California came to light. Everybody back home was excited to introduce their precious tasteful pineapple to the world. BeninFruit was born! Green is the new Golden - It is unlike anything you have tasted - It is not just pineapple, it is Benin Fruit.	http://beninfruit.com	85000/ 4 Rue Abbe Billaud 	 85000 La Roche Sur Yon	85000	Fruits and vegetables - import-export, Pineapple, Import, Grower Pineapple, Importateur Ananas	NA	NA	21504	46.67420672854944	-1.4249219890891345
