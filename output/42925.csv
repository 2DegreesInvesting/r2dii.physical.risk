We work with start-ups, medium-sized companies through to well-known companies on the German stock exchange. Resellers also form part of our long-standing customer base. Everyone appreciates our exceptional service and the diversity of the flexible packaging world. Protecting the environment and sustainability are top priorities for us, and were our focus early on in modern and sustainable packaging concepts. Since then, many of our products are up to 100% recyclable and others are compostable. As early as 2016, Lacers stopped using pouches with aluminium altogether, focussing on constant improvements to recyclability of packaging. Curious? Please get in touch with us. Together, we can bring your project to life. All products from a single supplier: Manufacturing, production, printing, design and logistics solutions. And, of course, we ensure ""just-in-time"" deliveries to your front door. We look forward to every new challenge and hope to receive a non-binding enquiry from you soon. We would be delighted to show you our performance strengths."	https://www.lacers.de/	Friedrich-Olbricht-Damm 62 	 13627 Berlin	13627	Packaging materials - paper and cardboard, Aroma protection packaging, coffee bag, Coffee packaging, Paper coffee packaging, Flat-bottomed bags, Kraft paper packaging, Kraft paper bags, Kraft paper Doypacks, Pouches with bottoms, stand-up pouches	Stand-up pouches Kraft paper brown High Barrier XXS | Stand-up pouch aluminum XL | Stand-up pouches black kraft paper High Barrier XXS | Stand-up pouch white matt High Barrier XS | Stand-up pouch white kraft paper High Barrier L | Stand-up pouch black matt High Barrier L | Stand-up pouch kraft paper brown ribbed High Barrier L | Stand-up pouch white gloss high barrier | Stand-up pouch black gloss High Barrier S | Stand-up pouches kraft paper brown with window top barrier 250x340+130mm	united kingdom	42925	52.538727837933244	13.293560469214533
