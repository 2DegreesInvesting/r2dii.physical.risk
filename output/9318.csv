Devoted to the farm work, our company has been always involved in increasing value addition opportunities in our environment in order to try to make the world a better place. Our pistachios are located in Castilla-La Mancha, about 720m above sea level. This is a perfect place for the cultivation of pistachios due to the geographical features and the climate conditions. Our arid land and the continental Mediterranean climate, characterized by cold winters and hot summers as well as the shortage of rain, guarantee the optimal conditions for obtaining the best crops of pistachios, famous for their intense flavour. These two features ensure excellent quality fruits. For this reason, this is a place in La Mancha whose name we do want to remember forever.	https://www.manolitosnuts.com	C/Ebanistas, S/N 	 13240 La Solana	13240	Fruits, dried, fresh pistachios, roasted pistachio, packed pistachios, pistachio meal	NA	NA	9318	38.9420328666828	-3.2387529925548293
