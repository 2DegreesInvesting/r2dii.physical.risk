Furthermore, the trade with sawmill waste wood, such as sawdust and wood chips for the pellet, paper and chipboard industry have become as much a part of our everyday business as the disposal of waste wood, and our own production in Bad Sobernheim, Rhineland-Palatinate, enables us to produce bark mulch in a wide range of grain sizes as well as fall protection coverings from bark and wood chips. Using the best machines available in the wood industry, we manufacture quality products that are far above the usual industry standard.	http://www.rindenmulch.de	Schepersweg 35 	 46485 Wesel	46485	Pulpwood, Wood chips and sawdust, bark mulch, Wood chips, Wood chips as fall protection, Wood shavings, Filter materials, biological, Riding arena surfaces, Sawdust, Bark production	Reitplatz- Hackschnitzel Nadelholz Micro 5-15 mm | Hackschnitzel Nadelholz G50 | Rindenhumus 0-20 mm | Rindenmulch 0-20 mm | Rindenmulch 10-40 mm | Rindenmulch 0-40 mm | Colourplay® Fallschutzbelag | Ökoplay® Fallschutzbelag | Reitplatz- Hackschnitzel Nadelholz G50 | Boifiltermaterial gemisch Rinde 20-40/Hackschnitzel G50	germany	10439	51.6659737658349	6.644380459407384
