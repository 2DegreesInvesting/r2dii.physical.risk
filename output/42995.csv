Most of the vitamins and other nutrients are very sensitive and loose their power the moment they get mixed with water, the longer they stay mixed, the less efficiently they work. INCAP infusion cap solves this problem, with its special technology, while it has a stylish design too. INCAP pet packaging is the solution that delivers your taste formulation with full potency & taste. If its mixed, it isn´t fresh The new-generation dispensing caps/closures from Incap offers a host of new possibilities for innovative product design. It is the most innovative dosing and dispensing closure that enables limitless opportunities in beverage, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. It stores a precise dose of dry liquid formula in an oxygen and moisture restrict chamber that only mixes water in the bottle just prior to consumption. The result is a new beverage category that delivers valuable nutraceuticals without fear of nutrient degradation. Our Incaps are made made of 100% recyclable plastic material, are 100% air- and humidity tight, are child resistant proofed (BSDA Standard) and easy to fill, close and assemble and are customer friendly applicable: Just Twist and push to activate. And last but not least, many satisfied customers. It’s intuitive and easy to use — simply twist and push down, and shake to freshly infuse vitamins and nutrients into the water.	http://www.incap-closures.com	Eintrachthof 5 	 72138 Kirchentellinsfurt	72138	Packaging, Infusion Caps, Dispensing Closures, Functional Dosing Caps, PET Bottle Closures	NA	NA	42995	48.54442685	9.150304805540138
