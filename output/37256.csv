Although the small, family-run business now grows around 90% of its plants locally at its 100-hectare site, Benoît and Damien Ripaud retain the same attitudes that motivated their father Joseph, who founded the nursery: travel to bring back fantastic plants that can be adapted to our climate. Giant bonsai from Japan, yuccas from Mexico, cycas from Costa Rica, collector maples from New Zealand, hundred-year-old olive trees and palm trees from Mediterranean countries: these are just a few of the exotic plants offered by this garden nursery where more than 200 species and 2 million plants are grown in the heart of the Vendée countryside. A million plants are sold every year in France. Today the company has 50 employees.	http://www.ripaudpepinieres.com/	Route de Chantonnay 	 85390 Cheffois	85390	Nurseries, olive trees, palm trees, mediterranean plants, rose gardens	NA	NA	37256	46.68079476249999	-0.8744041547502073
