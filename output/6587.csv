Carl Geiger founded an oil mill in 1899 in the German city of Marbach am Neckar, which was bought by the Switzerland-based Hochdorf Gruppe in 2015. The Marbach oil mill attaches great importance both to a gentle approach to further processing and to the origin and quality of the raw materials. The seeds used come predominantly from organically controlled cultivation. Our cold-pressed oils come from traditional seeds such as sunflowers or rape seed. We also produce special oils, such as apricot kernel oil and linseed. We carefully grind the press cakes to produce flours rich in fibre and protein for a range of uses and applications.	https://www.marbacher-oelmuehle.de/en/	Am alten Kraftwerk 8 	 71672 Marbach	71672	Cereals and grains, Almond oil, Organic flours, Vegetable proteins, Rapeseed oil, Safflower oil, Cooking oils, vegetable, Apricot kernel oil, Hempseed oil, linseed oil	Aprikosenkernmehl, entölt, biologisch | Erdnussmehl entölt biologisch und konventionell | Kürbiskernmehl entölt, biologisch und konventionell | Rapsöl, kaltgepresst, biologisch und konventionell Rapsöl | Sesamöl nativ, biologisch | Distelöl LL, kaltgepresst, biologisch | Hanföl, kaltgepresst | Mandelöl kaltgepresst | Sonnenblumenmehl entölt | Goldleinmehl, entölt	germany	6587	48.942681803013464	9.276936876062196
