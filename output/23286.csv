We are currently recruiting for qualified kitchen staff and enthusiastic group leaders interested in early responsibility and the chance to live in France or at our UK activity centre in Northumberland. With our emphasis placed firmly on the experience for children and students alike, we expect our staff to be enthusiastic and inspirational role models for young people.	https://chateau-beaumont.co.uk/	Chateau Les, Courges 	 53420 Chailland	53420	Travel and tourism, holiday farm for school trips	NA	NA	23286	48.226748900000004	-0.8796116892549513
