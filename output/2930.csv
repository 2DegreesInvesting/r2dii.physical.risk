It is a family company that has been engaged in agriculture from the start and that one day committed to modernizing the agriculture of that time by installing a forage dehydrator machine. The company is mainly engaged in the production, transformation and marketing of forage, mainly alfalfa from the Ebro Valley. For three generations now we have continued to commit, with the same enthusiasm and effort, to the company continuousness and to growing day by day with new projects that improve our products. Getting the trust of our customers at a national level has always been one of our great objectives. Now we are beginning to grow beyond our borders. The main objective is to maintain the highest possible quality in our forages. Thus we monitor the entire process, from the optimal time for mowing, for harvesting right up to the dehydration.	http://www.satanso.com	Carretera Gallur Sangüesa, Km 16. 50600 Tauste (zaragoza) 	 50660 Tauste	50660	Import-export - food and agriculture, Livestock and poultry - feed, agriculture	NA	NA	2930	41.970612450000004	-1.2906640999999999
