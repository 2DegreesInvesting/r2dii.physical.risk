We provide hard foil types for deep-drawing applications in the following rolls and formats: A-PET films, G/A/G films, G-PET films. In addition, we manufacture composite films that acquire various sealing, peeling and barrier properties through their enhancement with PE films. Our products are mainly used in forming, filling and locking systems as well as conventional deep-drawing plants for manufacturing blister packaging. Another area of application is the manufacturing of transparent packaging materials such as collapsible boxes, cylinders, etc. They can be sterilised via EtO sterilisation or gamma irradiation and used in primary or secondary packaging. A great advantage of PET is that it is an environmentally friendly material: It can be recycled and leaves no harmful residues when combusted.	http://www.sicht-pack-hagner.de/en/, https://sicht-pack-hagner.de/en/produkte/medizin-pharma/original/P100/	Musbacher Strasse 21-23 	 72280 Dornstetten	72280	Films, plastic, transparent films, Composite films, Anti-static film, Blister films, co extruded plastic films, extruded films, Films, technical, Laminated films, PET plastic films	NA	NA	42691	48.48820245	8.511521100889983
