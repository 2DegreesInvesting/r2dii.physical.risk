Our Sardinian and Corsican origins enable us to discover Sardinia's wonderful gastronomic heritage and Corsica's long-stranding traditions. We took this to the next level in April 2018, unveiling a concept unlike anything else on Corsica. Working with a curated selection of high quality ingredients, our painstaking manufacturing processes take place at our artisanal laboratory: processing produce from the sea such as roe of mullet, tuna and ling, cold-smoking techniques for Scottish salmon and yellow tuna using herbs from Cape Corse, creation of Cap Corse herbal marinades for octopus salad and manufacture of high quality fresh pasta. Our products are delivered throughout Europe. We use the full range of our expertise to reveal new flavours as well as reinventing a number of authentic traditional Corsican recipes.	https://www.maisondelabottarga.fr/shop, https://www.maisondelabottarga.fr/a-propos, https://www.maisondelabottarga.fr/services	Route de la Lagune 	 20600 Furiani	20600	Foods, precooked and gourmet, tuna roe pate, Craft food maker, Mullet roe, Mediterranean Caviar, Mullet botargo, Manufacturer of fresh pasta, Manufacturer of seafood produce, Whole mullet roe, Grated mullet roe	Boutargue de Mulet entière 1kg | Boutargue de Mulet 500gr | Boutargue de Mulet entière 150-170gr | Boutargue de Mulet entière 180-200gr | Boutargue de Mulet entière 500gr (mixte) | Boutargue de Mulet entière 120-140gr | Boutargue de Mulet râpée 500gr | Boutargue de Mulet râpée 90gr-105gr | Caviar Calvisius | Thon Rouge sous huile	france	11626	42.65496235	9.418320687952464
