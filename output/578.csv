This made it possible for us to offer even more efficient processes and more varied products, and consequently to fulfil the requirements of our customers even better. Our water baths and thermostats are available as standard equipment or special versions. As a contract manufacturer, we guarantee to our customers that we will execute all orders with great precision and reliability. In collaboration with selected qualified partners, we process all materials relevant for clean rooms, pharmacies and laboratories. We have specialised here in the production of demanding individual parts. As a module supplier, we install parts and components of various suppliers on installable modules for our customers.	https://www.lrt-arnsdorf.de/	Kleinwolmsdorfer Strasse 26 	 01477 Arnsdorf	01477	Refrigerants, Bath thermostats, Mechanical machining of plastic components, Laboratory equipment, Laboratory facilities, Precious metal laboratory apparatus, Laboratory apparatus for pharmacology, Laboratory circulators, Heating circulators, water baths	NA	NA	578	51.09578813588004	13.990323298241982
