Naturally natural – that's been the motto of the NutriPur brand for over five years. We have made it our goal to bring natural products for snacking and breakfast to the market. Anyone with a keen interest in the topics of diets and foodstuffs will soon realise that nowadays many products have more things in them than they should: Preservatives, colourings and, time and time again, sugar. Even our youngest children are being swamped with foods that are far too sugary – a situation not only with a negative outlook for health in the long term (overweight, diabetes, etc.), but that also distorts your sense of taste for a long time.	https://www.nutripur.eu/	Weststr. 35 	 06126 Halle	06126	Freeze-dried fruit, Dried fruits, chick-peas, Freeze-dried fruits, Organic fruits, Fruit mixes, strawberries, raspberries, Fruit powder, Raspberry powder	GemüseSnacks – Gefriergetrocknetes Gemüse – 20g und 100g | Kaffeeriegel – Caramel Macchiato | Kleine Racker – Gefriergetrocknete Erdbeeren & Bananen – 15 g | Cranberrys, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g | Erdbeeren, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g / 2,90 € (11,60 €/100 g) | Erdbeeren BIO, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g | Himbeeren, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g | Himbeeren BIO, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g | Mango, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g | Waldbeeren, gefriergetrocknet – ab 25 g	germany	9163	51.48018105	11.88972153233346
