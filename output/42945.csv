Tin cans are not just functional, they are also particularly well suited to promoting your brand. You can use tin packaging to advertise your brand or company name in an original way. This packaging gives added value to every product and it does not matter which industry you are operating in. For example, we have produced custom-made tin cans to promote shoe-cleaning sets, beer, cognac and sports items. Since 1998, we have had the widest range of standard tins in the region of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Our range of products can be divided into three categories: Custom-made, unprinted and printed tin cans. They can be used to store any goods, from coffee, tea, confectionery and biscuits to business gifts, cosmetics and even the renowned Faberg√© egg. We look forward to conceiving ideas in collaboration with you and producing tin packaging which prominently displays your products.	https://thebox-tinboxes.com/home	Stockheimer Ring 12 	 64720 Michelstadt	64720	Packaging, Aluminium tins, Tins as gift packaging, Tins, decorative, Containers for packaging purposes, Spice tins, Pill bottle, Metal packaging, Promotional cans made of metal, Containers for the drinks industry	NA	NA	42945	49.67989237788261	9.009778052715731
