The direction towards technology leadership was set when the company was founded in 1996 with the installation of the first FineTec production plant for moulded fibre in Germany. This landmark decision is continuously pursued and is also reflected in the regular further training and qualification of our motivated team of employees. Distributed over two high-performance production sites in Burbach/Siegerland, the company now has a production area of around 5000 square metres. With nine production lines and three finishing lines at present, we are one of the trendsetting and recognised companies in the area of constructive packaging solutions made from moulded fibre that is made of recovered paper material. The two production sites offer our customers a great deal of supply security and flexibility.	https://buhl-paperform.de/en/, https://www.bucpac.de/de/	Carl-Benz-Strasse 10-12 	 57299 Burbach	57299	Packaging, Egg packaging, Recyclable packaging, Protective packaging for glass bottles, Natural packaging, Shipment packaging, Environmentally-friendly packaging, Cushion mats, Durable packaging, Durable packaging materials	Individuelle Faserguss Verpackungslösungen | EimerSchutzpolster - BucPac® | SafePac | GlassPac | +corro - Verpackung mit Korrosionsschutz | +liqui - Verpackung mit Vermiculite	germany	9989	50.7410357	8.091486426264847
