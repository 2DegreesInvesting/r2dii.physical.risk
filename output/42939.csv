The platform is available in German and English. On plastship, overcapacity quantities and off-spec materials can just as easily be stored and requested as typical regranulate goods from continuous production. All raw materials can be prepared and searched on the basis of their specifications and properties. Plastics processors also have the opportunity to find fixed buyers for their production wastes or payroll services. Also integrated in the portal is the opportunity to place corresponding tenders if a search does not directly lead to a result. All available quote and search functions can be used free of charge.	https://plastship.com/home	Auf Der Lind 10 	 65529 Waldems	65529	Plastics - recovery and recycling, Plastic compounds, Plastic granulate, Plastic grist, PET regenerate material, Polyethylene regranulate, Polypropylene regranulate, ABS regranulate, Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers (ABS), Commercial waste disposal	Buy recycled plastics | Distribution of regranulates, recompounds, and regrinds | Recyclability assessment	united kingdom	42939	50.25845975	8.35670067021263
