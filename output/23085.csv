After 2 years perfecting a world unique concept, disposable cork paper straws are now available. Natural, biodegradable, neutral taste, pleasant feel and go well in both hot and cold drinks (eg. Irish coffee), they add an aesthetic and innovative touch to cocktails. Cork, a noble and ecological material, uses up a lot of CO². Our paper is ""PURE KRAFT"" quality (we do not use recycled paper due to the presence of ink) and our straws have undergone independent laboratory testing to ensure compliance with food standards. Manufacture in France (Auvergne) with French material, they are available with length 17 and 23 cm, inside diameter 6.2mm in standard versions.
