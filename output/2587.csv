It all began with imports of typical Turkish products that were not available in Western Europe at the time. The small business quickly grew into a large company. Since 2010, Tok Food has been part of the Danish company Nordex Food A/S. Nordex Food A/S produces typical Turkish soft cheese and other dairy products. Following years of close collaboration between the two companies, it was the logical decision for us to merge. Nordex Food A/S manufactures in Denmark, Austria and Romania. The company has around 350 employees all over the world. Today, our company is one of the leading wholesalers of Turkish and Eastern Mediterranean products on the European market. By relocating to Gronau in Westphalia (Germany), we were able to expand the International sales channels even further and supply retailers more quickly and efficiently. Tok Food also operates in several countries, with a particular focus on the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany. Thanks to its well-organised, multilingual team, we are able to operate on an international level.	https://tokfood.com	Einsteinring 5 D 	 48599 Gronau (westfalen)	48599	Import-export - food and agriculture, mediterrane levensmiddelen, groothandel food, etnische artikelen, levensmiddelen	NA	NA	2587	52.18899725	7.028777202256272
